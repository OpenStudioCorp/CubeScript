    <h1>So, you want to learn CubeScript?</h1>

    <p>Well, you've come to the right place!</p>

    <p>First, let's start with the basics. CubeScript is a scripting language based around the C style family of languages.</p>

    <p>What does that mean? Well, it means that CubeScript is a language that is based around the C programming language. If you've ever programmed in C, C++, C#, Java, or JavaScript, you'll find that CubeScript is very similar to those languages.</p>

    <p>Let's start with the basics. In CubeScript, there are two types of values: numbers and strings. Numbers are just that, numbers. Strings are a sequence of characters. For example, "Hello, world!" is a string. 123 is a number.</p>

    <p>Let's start with numbers. Numbers are pretty simple. You can add, subtract, multiply, and divide them. You can also use parentheses to group operations. For example, 1 + 2 * 3 is 7, but (1 + 2) * 3 is 9.</p> 

    <p>Here are some examples of operations:</p>

    <code>1 + 2</code>
    <code>1 - 2</code>
    <code>1 * 2</code>
    <code>1 / 2</code>
    <code>(1 + 2) * 3</code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to strings. Strings are a sequence of characters. For example, "Hello, world!" is a string. Strings can be added together, and you can also use the + operator to concatenate strings. For example, "Hello, " + "world!" is "Hello, world!".</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of operations you can do with Strings:</p>

    <code>Print("hello world!")</code>
    <code>Print("hello " + "world!")</code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to variables. Variables are used to store values. For example, you can store the number 1 in a variable called x by writing x = 1. You can also store strings in variables. For example, you can store the string "hello" in a variable called x by writing x = "hello".</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of operations you can do with variables:</p>

    <code>int x = 1</code>
    <code>string x = "hello"</code>
    <code>Print(x)</code>
    <code>Print(x + " world!")</code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to functions. Functions are used to perform a task. For example, you can write a function that adds two numbers together. You can also write a function that prints a string to the console.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of functions:</p>

    <code>function add(x, y) 
        {
            return x + y 
        }
    </code>

    <code>function say(x) 
        {
            Print(x) 
        }
    </code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to conditionals. Conditionals are used to perform a task if a condition is true. For example, you can write a conditional that prints a string to the console if a variable is equal to 1.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of conditionals:</p>

    <code>
        int x = 1;
        if (x == 1) 
        {
            Print("hello world!") 
        }
    </code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to loops. Loops are used to perform a task multiple times. For example, you can write a loop that prints a string to the console 10 times.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of loops:</p>

    <code>
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) 
        {
            Print("hello world!") 
        }
    </code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to arrays. Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. For example, you can store the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in an array called x by writing x = [1, 2, 3].</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of arrays:</p>

    <code>
        int[] x = [1, 2, 3];
        Print(x[0]);

        string[] x = {"hello", "world"};

        for (int i = 0; i < x.Length; i++) 
        {
            Print(x[i]) ;
        }
    </code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to objects. Objects are used to store multiple values in a single variable. For example, you can store the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in an object called x by writing x = {1, 2, 3}.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of objects:</p>

    <code>
        int[] x = {1, 2, 3};
        Print(x[0]);

        string[] x = {"hello", "world"};

        for (int i = 0; i < x.Length; i++) 
        {
            Print(x[i]);
        }
    </code>

    <p>Now, let's move on to classes. Classes are used to create objects. For example, you can create a class called Person that has a name and an age.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of classes:</p>

    <code>
        room Person 
        {
            string name = "";
            int age = 0;
        }

        Person person = new Person();
        person.name = "John";
        person.age = 30;

        Print(person.name);
        Print(person.age);
    </code>

    <p>thats all for now, more will be added later</p>
