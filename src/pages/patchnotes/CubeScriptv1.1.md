Welcome to the 1.1 version of CubeScript

This release includes some Bug Fixes and implements a new feature

CubeScript Project Creation version 1.0

This symbolises a new Release for a great thing

This version of the CPC unfortunatly only creates a csproj file and a cusp file for making a simple Console based app.

Hopefully the Next version improves the CPC enough that it allows you to create more then one Project!

thats all for now! take care!!!
