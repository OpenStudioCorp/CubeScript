            <p>
                Functions are defined using the <code>struct</code> keyword.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
struct main (string{} args)
{
    
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>Functions are a way to group code together and execute it when needed. Functions can be called from other
                functions or from the console.</p>
                <p>you can also do public struct or private struct if you need it public or private</p>

            <h2>Calling a function</h2>
            <p>
                When calling a function, just call it by name and pass any arguments it needs in the parentheses.

                the <code>While</code> keyword. ontop of that, using the <code>if else</code> keywords, you can check if

// you can also use the comment keyword to add comments to your code, which will be ignored by the compiler

//defining varibles like string, float, int, etc is done like this

public string name = "John Doe"; // string.
public float pi = 3.14; // float.
public int age = 18; // int.
public bool isAlive = true; // bool.

// adding the public keyword allows other classes to access the varible and not just the stuff in the main structure
// this could be useful if you want to use the varible in another class or something, or if you want to access it from a different file all together

// please keep note that setting it to public and not taking note of where your using the varible can cause problems and can make your code harder to read
// it may even cause you to get errors if you are not careful

// you can also set the type explicitly by using the type name before the variable name
// this makes the varible stick to the type you set it to instead of doing this

string name = "John Doe"; // string
Print(name) // Prints John Doe
// and then doing this




name = 123; // int
Print(name) // Prints 123

// this is not allowed in this language as it is a strongly typed language and will throw an error

// errors will mostly look like this under normal cases, unless you are using a library or something which the error function should be handeled and fixed to the library's needs

{Error} line 1:5: expected string, got int

[name = 123;]

unable to compile code
// you can also use the var keyword to make the compiler automatically detect the type of the varible and set it at runtime
// this is useful if you are not sure what type the varible will be, though if somehow the compiler cannot detect the type, it will throw an error
// same for changing the type of the varible

var name = "John Doe"; // string
Print(name) // Prints John Doe
// and then doing this

name = 123; // int
Print(name) // Prints 123

// if this happens and the varible has been read from, the compiler will change the type of the varible to the type of the value that is next assigned to it

// you can also use the const keyword to make the varible a constant, meaning that it cannot be changed after it has been set, even if it is a var varible

// most of the time, you will be using the var keyword to define varibles, but if you are sure of the type of the varible, you can use the type name to define the varible

// this launguage also supports arrays, which are defined like this

string{} names = {"John Doe", "Jane Doe", "Bob Doe"}; // string array

// you can also use the var keyword to make the compiler automatically detect the type of the array and set it at runtime

var names = {"John Doe", "Jane Doe", "Bob Doe"}; // string array

//there are 2 different types of arrays, static and dynamic

// static arrays are arrays that have a fixed size and cannot be changed after it has been set
// you can change the contents of the array but when you try to add or remove an item from the array, it will throw an error
// when you run out of the caracters you have in the array, any blank fields will return null

//static arrays are defined like this

string[3] names = {"John Doe", "Jane Doe", "Bob Doe"}; // string array


// dynamic arrays are arrays that have a dynamic size and can be changed after it has been set
// you can change the contents of the array and you can also add or remove an item from the array and blank spots will be removed and not replaced with null

//dynamic arrays are defined like this

string{} names = {"John Doe", "Jane Doe", "Bob Doe"}; // string array

// you can also use the var keyword to make the compiler automatically detect the type of the array and set it at runtime

var  names = {"John Doe", "Jane Doe", "Bob Doe"}; // string array

// notice how the brackets for defining the size of the array are missing, this is because the compiler will automatically detect the type of the array and set it at runtime
// nice and simple

// you can also use the const keyword to make the array a constant, meaning that it cannot be changed after it has been set, even if it is a var array

// now ive gotten some concern on how dynamic arrays resize on lets say, checking hoow many users in the instance of a game are online.

// the dynamic array will, if defined to do so, will check the max plyayer count will be what of the world.
// if the max player count is 10, then the array will be 10, if the max player count is 100, then the array will be 100, and so on and so forth
// saves people from having to define the array size and then having to change it later on
