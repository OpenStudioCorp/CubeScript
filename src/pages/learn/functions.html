//defining varibles like string, float, int, etc is done like this

public string name = "John Doe"; // string.
public float pi = 3.14; // float.
public int age = 18; // int.
public bool isAlive = true; // bool.

// adding the public keyword allows other classes to access the varible and not just the stuff in the main structure
// this could be useful if you want to use the varible in another class or something, or if you want to access it from a different file all together

// please keep note that setting it to public and not taking note of where your using the varible can cause problems and can make your code harder to read
// it may even cause you to get errors if you are not careful

// you can also set the type explicitly by using the type name before the variable name
// this makes the varible stick to the type you set it to instead of doing this

string name = "John Doe"; // string
print(name) // prints John Doe
// and then doing this




name = 123; // int
print(name) // prints 123

// this is not allowed in this language as it is a strongly typed language and will throw an error

// errors will mostly look like this under normal cases, unless you are using a library or something which the error function should be handeled and fixed to the library's needs
