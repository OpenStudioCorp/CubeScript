# welcome to the official CubeScript Home library!

this is the official CubeScript Home library, which contains all the basic commands and functions that are available in CubeScript. this library is automatically loaded when CubeScript starts to transpile your project, and is always available, so long as you use the CubeScript compiler located [here](https://cubescript.vercel.app).
