# Welcome to the official CubeScript 1.2.2 update!

This update brings some bug fixes to the CSVM transpiler

### bug fixes:

When compiling on Linux, the transpiler wont produce a output. this has now been fixed as of Friday November 10th 


## known bugs

with the Update checker for CSVM, it will output 
```
Error checking for updates: list indices must be integers or slices, not str
are you connected to the internet?
```
this is fine and doesn't effect the use of the Compiler in any way from my testing.

that's all for now, take care!
